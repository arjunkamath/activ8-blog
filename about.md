The Activ8 platform was born out of HII ACTIVE, an EU funded program that brought together universities, research institutes and commercial organizations
from Finland, Sweden and Italy to tackle the issues holding back the widespread utilization of IoT technologies.

Realizing an end-to-end IoT solution is a technological nightmare. There are several moving parts that are not designed to interwork, IoT is not web as
many coming from a web background tend to think, connectivity is painful, devices are constrained and geographically distributed and that's just the tip of the iceberg
of challenges.

The platform is in development and so you can expect things not to work smoothly from the go, but we are trying our best. Feedback and comments are always welcome.
